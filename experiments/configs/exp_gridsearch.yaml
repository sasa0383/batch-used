# Grid Search Parameters
# Specify parameters here with a list of values to iterate over.
# Each combination of these lists will create one experiment run.

  # AI hyperparameters (Genetic Algorithm) to sweep

  # Example: Sweeping a stat model parameter
  # bayesian.confidence_interval: [90, 95, 99] # How to represent nested params for search? Requires design.
  # Or maybe flatten parameter names for search:
